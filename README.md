# Adventure Game

This Repo contains Code for a  simple version of an old fashioned text base game, inspired in my native country.


## Project Guidelines

This is my completed student project based on this [Instrucctions](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2465/view).


## Project Tasks. 

Project must meet these basic key feautres in order to make it into a playable game.

  + The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
  
  + Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
  
  + The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
  
  + The game has conditions for winning and losing.
  
  + When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again. 
  
 
## Technologies Used

  Python Programing Language.
  
  
### Developmental Criteria

  + Output text to the console.

  + Import modules and use function from those modules-

  + Use input function with conditional.
  
  + Use conditional loop to handle invalid input.
  
  + Refractoring Code by defining and calling functions.
  
  + Use pycodestyle tool.
